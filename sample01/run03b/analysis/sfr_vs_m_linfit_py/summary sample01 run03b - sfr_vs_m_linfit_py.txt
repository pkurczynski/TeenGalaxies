RESULTS

FIGURE:  candels_2015a_sample01_run03b_sfr_inst_vs_m_line_new_clip_sim_z12_median_ellipse.pdf

CAPTION
Star Formation Rate (SFR$_{Inst}$; instantaneous) vs. Stellar Mass (M$_*$) in the redshift range $1.0 < z < 1.5$ for galaxies in combined CANDELS (spec-z) and UVUDF (photo-z) sample.  Outliers (red points) from an initial fit are clipped; Remaining galaxies (gray points) are used to determine the best fit (dark purple).  Results from Whitaker et al.~(2014; cyan) and the meta-analysis of Speagle et al.~(2014; red) are shown; dashed regions indicate extrapolations from the reported ranges in M$_*$.  Selection curves are shown in black; our data are insensitive to galaxies that would fall along the correlation, to the lower left of this curve.  The squared Pearson correlation coefficient and estimated intrinsic scatter (dex) are indicated by the text label.  A typical error ellipse is shown in the upper left, with half-width and half-height equal to the median error in log M$_*$ and log SFR respectively, and orientation determined by the median covariance.

3. Chisq experiment

Intrinsic scatter changes from 0.27 (chisq < 50) --> 0.29 (chisq < 100) when using sample which less stringent chisq criterion.  Other parameters (slope, intercept) are basically unchanged.

CONCLUSION
Revised SFR-M* analysis for sample01 is done for SFR_Inst vs M*.  Figure and caption above are e-mailed to EG for use in NSF 2015 proposal.

The attached figure is obtained from the most recent SpeedyMC run (reduced lower Age limit = 1 Myr).  Lowering the age limit makes very little difference to stellar mass estimates (only two galaxies with > 10 % discrepancy in mass estimate).  The new speedymc run makes a larger difference in SFR estimates.  There are 159 sources in the new sample (out of ~1100 total) with good speedymc fits that have discrepancies greater than 10% in SFR_Inst.  We will use the SFR_Inst values from the new run.

The attached figure incorporates new selection functions, based on revised fits of F435W flux to SFR_Inst (as opposed to SFR100 fits used previously).  The selection functions do not change appreciably.
