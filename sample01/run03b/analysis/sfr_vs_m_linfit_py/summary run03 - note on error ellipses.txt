summary run03 - note on error ellipses.txt

On interpreting error ellipses:

The angle of the error ellipse is not directly related to the correlation between
SFR and M*.  For example, see the data from two sources with nearly identical correlation
and yet very different angles to their error ellipses, Table 1.

Caption: Data taken from sfr_100_vs_m_refit_id_cov_corr_ellipse.txt.  (1) is the source
ID.  (2-5) are the x,y errors (log M*, log SFR respectively), covariance and correlation.
(6-7) are the squared errors in the rotated frame, (xp,yp), where covariance is zero.
These values are the squared values of semi-major and semi-minor axes of the error ellipse.  (8) is the angle in degrees of the semi-major axis, xp, of the error ellipse with the x axis.

The angle, theta, of the error ellipse is determined from

tan 2*theta =  2 sig_xy / (sigx^2 - sigy^2)					[1]

where sigx, sigy, sig_xy are the errors and covariances of the data value x,y.


Using the definition of correlation,

Corr_xy = sig_xy / (sigx*sigy)								[2]

Equation [1] becomes

tan 2*theta = 2 corr_xy * (sigx * sigy) / (sigx^2 - sigy^2)	[3]

So theta is not simply related to corr_xy, but it also depends on the magnitudes
of the individual errors, sigx, sigy.



In the example of Table 1, Source 897 has very large y error and small x error; its error ellipse is oriented "vertically" (ie theta ~ -90) whereas Source 453 has a very large x error and a small y error, so its error ellipse is oriented "horizontally" (ie theta ~ -4) even though they have the same correlation of ~ -0.50.  Notice also these sources have comparable sized error ellipses  (semi-major, semi-minor axes, see Columns 6,7).
